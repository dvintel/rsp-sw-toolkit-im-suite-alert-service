RFID Alert service provides the capabilities to monitor Intel速 RSP Controller status and send alerts. Intel速 RSP Controller status is updated periodically based on events sent through Heartbeat listener from EdgeX Core Data and alerts are generated when heartbeats are missed. Also, alert events are processed and posted to the REST endpoint specified.
